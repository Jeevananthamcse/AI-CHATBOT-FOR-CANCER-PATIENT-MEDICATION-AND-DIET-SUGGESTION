When you are healthy, eating enough food is often not a \nproblem. But when you are dealing with cancer and treatment, this can be a real challenge. \n\u2018When you have cancer, you may need extra protein and calories. At times, your diet may \nneed to include extra meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based proteins. If you have trouble \nchewing and swallowing, you may need to add sauces and gravies. Sometimes, you may \nneed to eat low-fiber foods instead of high-fiber ones. A dietitian can help you with any diet \nchanges you may need to make. \nSide effects from cancer treatment can lead to eating problems \nCancer treatments are designed to kill cancer cells. But these treatments can also damage \nhealthy cells. Damage to healthy cells can cause side effects that lead to eating problems. \nSee the list on page 9 to see the types of eating problems that cancer treatment may cause. \nCommon eating problems during cancer treatment include \nb \nappetite loss \n> \nnausea \n\u00bb \nchanges in sense of taste or smell \n\u00bb \nsore mouth \n> \nconstipation \n\u00bb \nsore throat and trouble swallowing \n\u00bb \ndiarrhea \n> \nvomiting \n\u00bb \ndry mouth \n> \nweight gain \n> \nlactose intolerance \n> \nweight loss \nYou may have a poor appetite or nausea because you are stressed about cancer and \ntreatment.

Here are some ways to manage: \n\u00bb \nEat plenty of protein and calories when you can. This helps you keep up your strength \nand helps rebuild tissues harmed by cancer treatment. \n\u00bb \nEat when you have the biggest appetite. \nYou may want to eat a bigger meal when you are \nfeeling your best and drink liquid meal replacements when your appetite is low. \n> \nIt\u2019s okay if you feel like you can't eat a lot of different foods. Eat the foods that sound good \nuntil you are able to eat more, even if it\u2019s the same thing again and again. You might also \ndrink protein shakes for extra nutrition. \n\u00bb \nDo not worry if you cannot eat at all some days. Spend this time finding other ways to \nfeel better and start eating when you can. Tell your doctor if you cannot eat for more than \n2 days. \n\u00bb \nDrink plenty of liquids. It is even more important to get plenty to drink on days when \nyou cannot eat. Drinking a lot helps your body get the liquid it needs. Most adults should \ndrink 8 to 12 cups of liquid a day. You may find this easier to do if you keep a water bottle \nnearby. Also, try some of the clear liquids listed on page 41. \nTaking special care with food to avoid foodborne illness \nSome cancer treatments can make you prone to foodborne illness. When this happens, you \nneed to take special care in the way you handle and prepare food. \n> \nKeep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. \n> \nPut leftovers in the refrigerator as soon as you have finished eating. \n> \nScrub all raw fruits and vegetables with \na brush and water before you eat them. \n> \nScrub fruits and vegetables that have \nrough surfaces and peels, such as \nmelons, oranges, and avocados, with \na brush and water before you cut or \npeel them. \n> \nSoak frozen fruits and vegetables in \nwater and rinse if you are not going \nto cook them (for a smoothie, for \ninstance). If cooking, you do not need \nto wash frozen fruits and vegetables. \n1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)"

Foods and liquids pass through the bowel so quickly that your body cannot absorb \nenough nutrition, vitamins, minerals, and water from them. This can cause dehydration \n(which occurs when your body has too little water). Diarrhea can be mild or severe and \nlast a short or long time. \nWhy it happens \nDiarrhea can be caused by cancer treatments such as radiation therapy to the abdomen or \npelvis, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. These treatments cause diarrhea because they can \nharm healthy cells in the lining of your large and small bowel. Diarrhea can also be caused \nby infections, medicine used to treat constipation, or antibiotics. \nWays to manage with food \n\u00bb \nDrink plenty of fluids to replace those you lose from \ndiarrhea and prevent dehydration. Examples include water, \nginger ale, and sports drinks such as Gatorade and Propel. \nYou can see a list of more clear liquids on page 41. \n\u00bb \nLet carbonated drinks lose their fizz before you drink \nthem. Add extra water if drinks make you thirsty or sick to \nyour stomach. \n\u00bb \nEat5 or 6 small meals each day instead of 3 large meals. Many people find it easier to \neat less food more often. \n\u00bb \nEatfoodsand drink liquids that are high in sodium and potassium. When you \nhave diarrhea, your body loses these substances and it is important to replace them. \nLiquids with sodium include bouillon, fat-free broth, or sports beverages such as \nGatorade or Propel. Foods high in potassium include bananas, tomatoes, and baked, \nboiled, or mashed potatoes. \n\u00bb \nEatlow-fiber foods. Low-fiber foods include plain or vanilla yogurt, white toast, and \nwhite rice. You can find a list of more low-fiber foods on page 45. \n\u00bb \nEatfoodsand drink liquids at room temperature, neither too hot nor too cold. \nWwww.cancer.gov \n15"

Be sure to tell your doctor or nurse if \nthe medicine is not helping. Your doctor may prescribe another. You may need to \ntake these medicines 1 hour before each treatment and for a few days after. The type \nof cancer treatment you get and how you react to it affects how long you need to \ntake these medicines. You may also want to talk with your doctor or nurse about \nacupuncture. It might also help. \nPrevent nausea. One way to prevent vomiting is to prevent nausea. You can learn \nmore about nausea on page 21. \nCall your doctor if your vomiting is severe or lasts for more than 1 or 2 days. \nVomiting can lead to dehydration (which occurs when your body does not have \nenough water).
